## Weather Dashboard

This is a weather application. I used a weather api to get data and display the current day's conditions plus a 5 day forecast.

## How it works

Click the link: https://kevinlacarrubba.github.io/WeatherAPI/
When the page loads there is a search bar on the top left of the page. Enter a city or a city and state if you would like to be more specific. The box to the right of the search bar will display the city, state, and date. The info below will tell the current conditons which include the temperature, wind humidity and the uv index. The uv index will be highligthed in either green yellow orange or red to signify the danger of the uvindex that day. Below will be a 5 day forecast for the city you entered. On the left below the search bar, previous searched cities will be stored. You may click these cities to link back to the search.
There is also a clear all button which will erase previous searched cities.
